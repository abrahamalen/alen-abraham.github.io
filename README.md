Have successfully migrated my website from hugo-coder to Papermod theme.
Feels like there is more customization options for Papermod.Existing website migration is completed, now new features, contents and some bug  will be added.

A static blog/portfolio website built using Hugo. [[See Live](https://alenabraham.me)]

Built on top of the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.
