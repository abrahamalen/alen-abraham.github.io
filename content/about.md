I'm **Alen Abraham** (he/him), a Software Engineer from Kerala, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³; focused on **DevOps**, **Cloud** and **Cloud native** environments along with a strong interest towards Open-Source. I like to learn new technologies, and get hands-on experience with latest trends. I write tech and career related blogposts on my website and on various other platforms.  

I graduted as an Electronics and Communication Engineer from College of Engineering Chengannur(CEC) on July 2021. Switched to IT and Design field because of pandemic and now loving experimenting and working on everything in the industry.
