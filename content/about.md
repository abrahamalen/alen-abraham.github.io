I'm **Alen Abraham** (he/him), a Software Engineer from Kerala, India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. I focus on **DevOps**, **Cloud** and **Cloud native** environments along with a strong interest towards Open-Source. I like to learn new technologies, especially topics related to software engineering and get hands-on experience with latest trends. I write tech and career related blogposts here on my website and on various other platforms.  

I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering(ECE) from [College of Engineering Chengannur(CEC)](https://ceconline.edu/) on July 2021. Currently, I am working full-time as a **Site Reliability Engineer(SRE)** at Tata Consultancy Services(TCS) and as an **Open Source Contributor** at [Naas.ai](https://www.naas.ai/).  



So, this is my blog, one of my most procrastinated projects. I wish you could learn something from here and more additions are gonna happen to this website. If you want to stay in touch, reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/op__trojan) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alenabraham/).
